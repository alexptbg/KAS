    phase(): the terminator phase angle as a fraction of a full circle (i.e., 0 to 1). Both 0 and 1 correspond to a New Moon, and 0.5 corresponds to a Full Moon.
    illumination(): the illuminated fraction of the Moon (0 = New, 1 = Full).
    age(): the age of the Moon, in days.
    distance(): the distance of the Moon from the centre of the Earth (kilometres).
    diameter(): the angular diameter subtended by the Moon as seen by an observer at the centre of the Earth (degrees).
    sundistance(): the distance to the Sun (kilometres).
    sundiameter(): the angular diameter subtended by the Sun as seen by an observer at the centre of the Earth (degrees).
    new_moon(): the time of the last New Moon (UNIX timestamp).
    next_new_moon(): the time of the next New Moon (UNIX timestamp).
    full_moon(): the time of the Full Moon in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
    first_quarter(): the time of the first quarter in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
    last_quarter(): the time of the last quarter in the current lunar cycle (UNIX timestamp).
    phase_name(): the phase name.
